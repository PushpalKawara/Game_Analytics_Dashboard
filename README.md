## 🧠 Why I Built This

During my internship as a **Game Analyst**, I constantly had to:

* Manually calculate drop-off and retention
* Juggle between different tools
* Present insights to the team quickly

So, I decided to create one **streamlined toolkit** where all insights could live in one place.

> 🧩 This tool is entirely built from scratch by me. No company code or files are used.
